 # The Sequence

 
 The Recamán's series is named after it's creator Bernardo Recamán Santos.
 Up to this day, this sequence keeps fascinating mathematicians (and me) for it's alternance of order and chaos.
 The most interesting part of it is that it can fit into art, music and other areas!
 
 As all mathematical things, It has a definition with all of that strange symbols that math uses. **That won't be necessary here.**

 
 All we need to know is:
- There is a **counter** that starts at 1 and we add 1 to it every time
- The number always wants to go back by the counter value,
        if it can't, or the number was already used, It goes Foward

 You can run the code to see a brief demonstration of how the sequence works.
