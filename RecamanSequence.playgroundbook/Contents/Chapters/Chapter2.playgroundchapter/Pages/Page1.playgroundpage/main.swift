/*: # Arc Visualization
 This is one of many ways to visualize this sequence.
 
 It consits of arcs, or curves, from the current number to the next one.
 
 Curiosity\: If you happen to see circles (spoiler\: there're a lot of them), It means that the number decresed, but then increased again!
 
 Here's a question: How do you think this series would sound?
